# passwordGenerator

GitHub deploy link: https://marioarmstrong.github.io/passwordGenerator/

The password generator is not finished. It will have to be resubmmited for a better grade later. Currently it prompts you with the question "how many characters do you want?", which in turn creates a password according to your response. The downside is I haven't been able to get the button to create the prompt to pop up, so the prompt pops up when you first acces the page.

Also, I only have one question prompt on the page so the user cannot tailor their password beyond the amount of characters.
