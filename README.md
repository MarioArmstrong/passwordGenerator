# passwordGenerator

GitHub deploy link: https://marioarmstrong.github.io/passwordGenerator/

The full functionality of the generate button click is working now. Once the button is click the question prompts populate the screen, and the truthiness of the answers will affect the password that is generated.

The one bug that still remains is the refresh of the page when trying to run newly generated passwords. At the moment, when you click the button again the new password is tacked onto the existing password. I thought that assigning the empty string at the beginning of the function would clear out what was there before, but it did not work. This will need to be addressed and fixed for the next submission.
